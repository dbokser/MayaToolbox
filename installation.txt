To install, drop the userSetup.py file into your Maya startup scripts directory.  

By default, this is:

Mac:
/Users/YOUR USERNAME/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/YOUR MAYA VERSION/scripts/

Windows:
C:\Users\YOUR USERNAME\Documents\maya\YOUR MAYA VERSION\scripts\

After restarting Maya, you can use the script's functions in your own scripts and shelf buttons.
